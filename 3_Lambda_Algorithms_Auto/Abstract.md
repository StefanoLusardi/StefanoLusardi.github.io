The third talk in the series is dedicated to algorithms. There will be an overview of what the STL offers and how we can use it.
We will also focus on the usage of lambda functions as they perfectly fit as simple callable objects to be used inside STL algorithms to bring them to the next level. 
This will limit the amount of boilerplate code that previously was needed to deal with a so called functors object.
Will be examined the new keyword auto.
