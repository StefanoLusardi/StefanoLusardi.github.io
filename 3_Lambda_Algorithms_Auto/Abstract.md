The third talk in the series is dedicated to algorithms. 
There will be an overview of which algorithms the STL offers and how we can use them to improve code readability and expressivity.
We will also focus on the usage of lambda functions as they perfectly fit as simple callable objects to be used inside STL algorithms to bring them to the next level. 
This will limit the amount of boilerplate code that previously was needed to deal with a so called functors object or to pass around function pointers thanks to the new std::function class.
Lambdas provide also a way to enforce functional programming style: it is now possible to declare and use a function inside a function.
Finally will be examined the new keyword auto and its usage in template programming and in functions with trailing return type.
