# Modern C++: Standard practices from Standard library #

Hi, welcome to my personal [github.io](https://stefanolusardi.github.io)!  
In this repository I am collecting my personal thoughts and talks about Modern C++.

I try to gather very brief overviews of several specific language features such as:
* [1. Modern C++ introduction, C++ Standards and Compiler Enhancements](https://stefanolusardi.github.io/#/1)
* [2. Move Semantics and Smart Pointers](https://stefanolusardi.github.io/#/2)
* [3. STL Algorithms, Lambda Expressions and auto](https://stefanolusardi.github.io/#/3)
* [4. C++17 new features](https://stefanolusardi.github.io/#/4)

I originally developed this series of talks for personal research. I also used this material in order to give several talks at my [current company](https://www.pilatus-aircraft.com/en) in which I develop C++ desktop applications for Avionic Training and Simulation Systems.
